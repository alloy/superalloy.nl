h3. Another day, another name

Yesterday I wrote "an article about JSTestSan":/2009/04/13/js-test-san.html. Today, however, I decided to move the repo to "our Fingertips account":http://github.com/Fingertips/headless-squirrel/tree/master and also change its name to *“Headless Squirrel”*.

The command-line tool is still called <code>jstest</code>, only the name and locations were changed. I’ve updated the previous post to reflect these changes.
